This project was generated by Tom Dakan from https://github.com/TomDakan/Copier_Python3.13_Default
## Getting Started
This project uses `mise` to manage project dependencies and `pdm` for python package management. To get started, run the following commands:
```bash
mise install
pdm install
```
## Features & Tooling
This project comes pre-configured with the following tools to streamline development and ensure code quality:
    ### Project Management
    * **typed-settings**: Alternative to pydantic-settings for managing application settings.



    ### Development & Code Quality* **pytest**: For running the test suite.* **pytest-cov**: For measuring test coverage.* **ruff**: All-in-one linter, formatter, and import sorter.* **commitizen**: For standardized, conventional commit messages.* **mypy**: For static type checking.* **safety**: For checking dependencies against known security vulnerabilities.* **bandit**: For finding common security issues in code.* **python-semantic-release**: For automated versioning, changelog generation, and releases (used in CI).




    ### Code Coverage
    This project uses [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) to measure code coverage.
    To run the tests and generate a coverage report, run `pdm run cov`.



    ### Security
    This project uses [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to check for common security vulnerabilities. To run the security checks, run `pdm run security`.

## Pytest Markers
This project uses the following pytest markers:

    - `unit`: Marks fast, self-contained unit tests.

    - `integration`: Marks tests that require external resources (e.g., database, network).

    - `slow`: Marks tests that are slow to run.

    - `network`: Marks tests that require a live network connection.

    ### Documentation* **mkdocs**: A static site generator for project documentation.* **mkdocs-material**: Theme for MkDocs.* **mkdocstrings[python]**: For automatically generating API documentation from docstrings.

    ### Automated Releases
    This project uses [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/) to automate versioning, changelog generation, and package publishing. Releases are triggered automatically in CI when changes are merged to the `main` branch.
    **Note:** For automated publishing to PyPI to work, you need to configure [Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) on PyPI for this project.

    ### Automated Dependency Updates
    This project uses [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to automatically create Pull Requests for keeping dependencies up-to-date.
### QoL
This project is configured to abstract common tasks by calling `pdm run <script_name>` (or `just <script_name>`) including:

* **`format-check`**: Check if code formatting is correct (Ruff).
* **`format`**: Apply code formatting (Ruff).
* **`lint`**: Run the linter and import sorter (Ruff).
* **`type-check`**: Run static type checking (MyPy).
* **`test`**: Run the test suite (pytest).
* **`deploy`**: Placeholder for deployment tasks.
* **`safety-check`**: Check for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* **`bandit-check`**: Run Bandit security linter.
* **`export-docs-reqs`**: Export documentation dependencies for Read the Docs.
* **`adr`**: Create a new Architecture Decision Record.
* **`qa`**: Run the full quality assurance suite.
### Optional Features
* **Task Runner**: Choose between `pdm` and `just` for running project tasks.
* **Configuration Library**: Choose between `none` and `typed-settings` for managing application settings.


* **Automated Releases**: Use `python-semantic-release` for automated versioning, changelog generation, and package publishing.



* **Dependency Vulnerability Checks**: Use `safety` to check for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies.


* **Secret Detection**: Use `detect-secrets` to find secrets in the codebase.


* **Documentation Generation**: Use `mkdocs` and `mkdocstrings` to generate project documentation.



* **ADR Management**: Include a script for managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
